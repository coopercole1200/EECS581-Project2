Hey everyone! Hope is all well! We have created a simple and robust minesweeper for you to play with!

Please have a look around the repository to view our code and image files. The documentation folder will have structure on how this specific game was made and how it took us to get to this point!

In the documentation folder you can find the worklog, the system architecture document and the user stories document

To start our minesweeper program, type in "python3 src/main.py" and press enter to execute the program and there it goes!

Enjoy playing minesweeper!

Best,

Dustin, Colin, Riley, Hannah, Ryland, Jacob
